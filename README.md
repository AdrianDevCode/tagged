Car-To-Car Communications

This project combines the Vehicle VIN API and Firebase Authentication and Realtime Databases to create an anonymous car-to-car messaging application.

The logic: We created a user database through registration and authentication which allows users to communicate to each other simply by knowing the license plate number of the user they would like to communicate with.
